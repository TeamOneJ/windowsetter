Windowsetter
===
I use this script to arrange four Finder windows in quarters with some margins on all sizes upon login. It has detection of multiple screens and screen sizes and adjusts accordingly depending on what screens I’m attached to.

I can probably do this with [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) but haven’t bothered to figure out how.

Installation

Edit the script paths and then save this as an Application and then add it to your login items.
